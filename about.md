<center>Hey! 👋</center>

&emsp; My name is <b>Arkadiusz Czarnowski</b> and I am  <b>positively programmed programmer</b>. 
I am fascinated on the programming, personal development and body shaping (strength training, calisthenics, nutition).

&emsp; The blog was created in order to transfer thoughts and acquired knowledge in the simplest possible language.
Mainly you will find here content related to Java and related technologies, as well as my experience related to the work of a programmer, both full-time and running a business.

&emsp; There will also be interesting facts that can have a positive impact on the quality of your well-being, work and health. I'll try to keep it as short and concise as possible - the so-called self <b>"meat"</b> 😉

<center>The key is to develop, make mistakes, draw conclusions and discover new opportunities❗</center>

<strong><center>Jest pięknie!😎</center></strong>
